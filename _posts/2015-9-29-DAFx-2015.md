I'll be at the 18th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx) in Trondheim, Norway this December presenting the paper "Improving the robustness of the iterative solver in state-space modelling of guitar distortion circuitry". The companion material is already [available](/DAFx15) but won't make much sense until the proceedings are published. More on this later!
