### About Me

My name is Ben Holmes and I am a PhD student at the Sonic Arts Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast. I began my PhD in 2014, previously completing my undergraduate degree at the University of York.  

### Research Interests

The focus of my PhD is on the **modelling of nonlinear audio effects**. This primarily involves circuit modelling, real-time algorithm implementation, and also the measurement and analysis of audio effects. Vintage audio effects present a highly interesting set of problems, with a significant amount of my research so far having been on the Dallas Rangemaster Treble Booster pedal. There are many more cases I'm hoping to study as well:
