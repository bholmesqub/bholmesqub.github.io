Hi! My name is Ben Holmes and I am a PhD student based in the Sonic Arts Research Centre (but apart of the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at Queen's University Belfast. The topic of my PhD is **nonlinear circuit emulation with a real-time audio focus**.

This website hosts project pages for my academic code and research tools. This will mainly be MATLAB code, but will hopefully develop to some finished tools and models in C++.

If you want to contact me, my email and github account are linked at the bottom of each page, but you can also find me on twitter ([@benjamholmes](https://twitter.com/benjamholmes)), [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/bencholmes), and [academia.edu](https://qub.academia.edu/BenHolmes).
