### More Information

Hi! My name is Ben Holmes, and am currently a research student at Queen's University Belfast. The focus of the research is **nonlinear circuit emulation with a real-time audio focus**.

This website hosts project pages for my academic code and research tools. This will mainly be MATLAB code, but will hopefully develop to some finished programmes in C++. I aim to release all of my research code for properly open research.
